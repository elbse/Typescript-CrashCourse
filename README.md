# 📘 TypeScript Crash Course

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and code examples from a **TypeScript crash course** I'm following on YouTube.  
It’s meant to help me (and others) understand how TypeScript improves JavaScript with **static typing**, **interfaces**, **generics**, and more.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Build a solid foundation in **TypeScript**
- Learn how to use TypeScript with **Node.js** and **React**
- Practice real-world examples and small projects

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**
- **Node.js**
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **VS Code** with TypeScript extensions

---
